File: `0-binary_to_uint.c`

### 1. Print Binary

Prints the binary representation of a number.  
File: `1-print_binary.c`

### 2. Get Bit

Returns the value of a bit at a given index.  
File: `2-get_bit.c`

### 3. Set Bit

Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.  
File: `3-set_bit.c`

### 4. Clear Bit

Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.  
File: `4-clear_bit.c`

### 5. Flip Bits

Returns the number of bits to flip to get from one number to another.  
File: `5-flip_bits.c`
