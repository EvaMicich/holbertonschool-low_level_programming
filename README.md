## Introduction

The Low Level Programming track at Holberton School aims to provide students with a solid foundation in the C programming language and an understanding of computer systems. The projects in this repository will cover various topics such as variables, loops, functions, pointers, and memory management. Students will also learn about algorithms and data structures, as well as gain experience working with the Linux operating system.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvaMicich/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```


Navigate to the desired project directory and compile the C files using the `gcc` command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o output
```


To run the compiled program, use the following command:


```bash
./output
```
